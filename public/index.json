Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

So I had the idea of letting other people run their own linux virtual machines on it, kinda like how gcp offers \u0026ldquo;spot\u0026rdquo; vms for much cheaper as it uses excess compute capacity.\nObviously I can\u0026rsquo;t provide this as a paid service since that comes with a lot of liability and legal documents to protect yourself, so I just offer it as a free service for friends.\nVM Templates \u0026amp; Operating Systems I already use Proxmox VE for personal vms so I\u0026rsquo;m using my existing setup for this service.\nCurrently I have a vm template for Debian 13 \u0026ldquo;Trixie\u0026rdquo;, which lets me spin up new machines with unattended updates and the setup process already complete.\nNetworking \u0026amp; Public IPs I had to get a bit creative here as residential internet connections don\u0026rsquo;t let you have multiple public ip addresses on your connection.\nTo get around this I run a vps with multiple public ips which has a secure encrypted tunnel back into a tailscale gateway running inside my home network which exposes the vm subnets/network, this setup also means I don\u0026rsquo;t have to install tailscale on any vms.\nIf someone connected to [public_vps_ip]:22 it gets relayed to [private_vm_ip]:22 through the tunnel and it all happens seemlessly.\nThis all happens behind the scenes without any noticeable latency (1-2ms latency between vps and my network, tailscale gateway gets under 0.2ms to vms)\nInternal Network Security Obviously one of the main security risks with running a service like this in my Homelab isn\u0026rsquo;t really external attacks, its vms being breached and then attacking or breaking into stuff on my home network.\nTo mitigate this I have a security group on the Proxmox firewall with a list of rules denying access to anything on my local network except the router (for internet) and tailscale gateway (to expose services). Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

So I had the idea of letting other people run their own linux virtual machines on it, kinda like how gcp offers \u0026ldquo;spot\u0026rdquo; vms for much cheaper as it uses excess compute capacity.\nObviously I can\u0026rsquo;t provide this as a paid service since that comes with a lot of liability and legal documents to protect yourself, so I just offer it as a free service for friends.\nVM Templates \u0026amp; Operating Systems I already use Proxmox VE for personal vms so I\u0026rsquo;m using my existing setup for this service.\nCurrently I have a vm template for Debian 13 \u0026ldquo;Trixie\u0026rdquo;, which lets me spin up new machines with unattended updates and the setup process already complete.\nNetworking \u0026amp; Public IPs I had to get a bit creative here as residential internet connections don\u0026rsquo;t let you have multiple public ip addresses on your connection.\nTo get around this I run a vps with multiple public ips which has a secure encrypted tunnel back into a tailscale gateway running inside my home network which exposes the vm subnets/network, this setup also means I don\u0026rsquo;t have to install tailscale on any vms.\nIf someone connected to [public_vps_ip]:22 it gets relayed to [private_vm_ip]:22 through the tunnel and it all happens seemlessly.\nThis all happens behind the scenes without any noticeable latency (1-2ms latency between vps and my network, tailscale gateway gets under 0.2ms to vms)\nInternal Network Security Obviously one of the main security risks with running a service like this in my Homelab isn\u0026rsquo;t really external attacks, its vms being breached and then attacking or breaking into stuff on my home network.\nTo mitigate this I have a security group on the Proxmox firewall with a list of rules denying access to anything on my local network except the router (for internet) and tailscale gateway (to expose services). Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

So I had the idea of letting other people run their own linux virtual machines on it, kinda like how gcp offers \u0026ldquo;spot\u0026rdquo; vms for much cheaper as it uses excess compute capacity.\nObviously I can\u0026rsquo;t provide this as a paid service since that comes with a lot of liability and legal documents to protect yourself, so I just offer it as a free service for friends.\nVM Templates \u0026amp; Operating Systems I already use Proxmox VE for personal vms so I\u0026rsquo;m using my existing setup for this service.\nCurrently I have a vm template for Debian 13 \u0026ldquo;Trixie\u0026rdquo;, which lets me spin up new machines with unattended updates and the setup process already complete.\nNetworking \u0026amp; Public IPs I had to get a bit creative here as residential internet connections don\u0026rsquo;t let you have multiple public ip addresses on your connection.\nTo get around this I run a vps with multiple public ips which has a secure encrypted tunnel back into a tailscale gateway running inside my home network which exposes the vm subnets/network, this setup also means I don\u0026rsquo;t have to install tailscale on any vms.\nIf someone connected to [public_vps_ip]:22 it gets relayed to [private_vm_ip]:22 through the tunnel and it all happens seemlessly.\nThis all happens behind the scenes without any noticeable latency (1-2ms latency between vps and my network, tailscale gateway gets under 0.2ms to vms)\nInternal Network Security Obviously one of the main security risks with running a service like this in my Homelab isn\u0026rsquo;t really external attacks, its vms being breached and then attacking or breaking into stuff on my home network.\nTo mitigate this I have a security group on the Proxmox firewall with a list of rules denying access to anything on my local network except the router (for internet) and tailscale gateway (to expose services). Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

So I had the idea of letting other people run their own linux virtual machines on it, kinda like how gcp offers \u0026ldquo;spot\u0026rdquo; vms for much cheaper as it uses excess compute capacity.\nObviously I can\u0026rsquo;t provide this as a paid service since that comes with a lot of liability and legal documents to protect yourself, so I just offer it as a free service for friends.\nVM Templates \u0026amp; Operating Systems I already use Proxmox VE for personal vms so I\u0026rsquo;m using my existing setup for this service.\nCurrently I have a vm template for Debian 13 \u0026ldquo;Trixie\u0026rdquo;, which lets me spin up new machines with unattended updates and the setup process already complete.\nNetworking \u0026amp; Public IPs I had to get a bit creative here as residential internet connections don\u0026rsquo;t let you have multiple public ip addresses on your connection.\nTo get around this I run a vps with multiple public ips which has a secure encrypted tunnel back into a tailscale gateway running inside my home network which exposes the vm subnets/network, this setup also means I don\u0026rsquo;t have to install tailscale on any vms.\nIf someone connected to [public_vps_ip]:22 it gets relayed to [private_vm_ip]:22 through the tunnel and it all happens seemlessly.\nThis all happens behind the scenes without any noticeable latency (1-2ms latency between vps and my network, tailscale gateway gets under 0.2ms to vms)\nInternal Network Security Obviously one of the main security risks with running a service like this in my Homelab isn\u0026rsquo;t really external attacks, its vms being breached and then attacking or breaking into stuff on my home network.\nTo mitigate this I have a security group on the Proxmox firewall with a list of rules denying access to anything on my local network except the router (for internet) and tailscale gateway (to expose services). Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

So I had the idea of letting other people run their own linux virtual machines on it, kinda like how gcp offers \u0026ldquo;spot\u0026rdquo; vms for much cheaper as it uses excess compute capacity.\nObviously I can\u0026rsquo;t provide this as a paid service since that comes with a lot of liability and legal documents to protect yourself, so I just offer it as a free service for friends.\nVM Templates \u0026amp; Operating Systems I already use Proxmox VE for personal vms so I\u0026rsquo;m using my existing setup for this service.\nCurrently I have a vm template for Debian 13 \u0026ldquo;Trixie\u0026rdquo;, which lets me spin up new machines with unattended updates and the setup process already complete.\nNetworking \u0026amp; Public IPs I had to get a bit creative here as residential internet connections don\u0026rsquo;t let you have multiple public ip addresses on your connection.\nTo get around this I run a vps with multiple public ips which has a secure encrypted tunnel back into a tailscale gateway running inside my home network which exposes the vm subnets/network, this setup also means I don\u0026rsquo;t have to install tailscale on any vms.\nIf someone connected to [public_vps_ip]:22 it gets relayed to [private_vm_ip]:22 through the tunnel and it all happens seemlessly.\nThis all happens behind the scenes without any noticeable latency (1-2ms latency between vps and my network, tailscale gateway gets under 0.2ms to vms)\nInternal Network Security Obviously one of the main security risks with running a service like this in my Homelab isn\u0026rsquo;t really external attacks, its vms being breached and then attacking or breaking into stuff on my home network.\nTo mitigate this I have a security group on the Proxmox firewall with a list of rules denying access to anything on my local network except the router (for internet) and tailscale gateway (to expose services). Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

So I had the idea of letting other people run their own linux virtual machines on it, kinda like how gcp offers \u0026ldquo;spot\u0026rdquo; vms for much cheaper as it uses excess compute capacity.\nObviously I can\u0026rsquo;t provide this as a paid service since that comes with a lot of liability and legal documents to protect yourself, so I just offer it as a free service for friends.\nVM Templates \u0026amp; Operating Systems I already use Proxmox VE for personal vms so I\u0026rsquo;m using my existing setup for this service.\nCurrently I have a vm template for Debian 13 \u0026ldquo;Trixie\u0026rdquo;, which lets me spin up new machines with unattended updates and the setup process already complete.\nNetworking \u0026amp; Public IPs I had to get a bit creative here as residential internet connections don\u0026rsquo;t let you have multiple public ip addresses on your connection.\nTo get around this I run a vps with multiple public ips which has a secure encrypted tunnel back into a tailscale gateway running inside my home network which exposes the vm subnets/network, this setup also means I don\u0026rsquo;t have to install tailscale on any vms.\nIf someone connected to [public_vps_ip]:22 it gets relayed to [private_vm_ip]:22 through the tunnel and it all happens seemlessly.\nThis all happens behind the scenes without any noticeable latency (1-2ms latency between vps and my network, tailscale gateway gets under 0.2ms to vms)\nInternal Network Security Obviously one of the main security risks with running a service like this in my Homelab isn\u0026rsquo;t really external attacks, its vms being breached and then attacking or breaking into stuff on my home network.\nTo mitigate this I have a security group on the Proxmox firewall with a list of rules denying access to anything on my local network except the router (for internet) and tailscale gateway (to expose services). Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

So I had the idea of letting other people run their own linux virtual machines on it, kinda like how gcp offers \u0026ldquo;spot\u0026rdquo; vms for much cheaper as it uses excess compute capacity.\nObviously I can\u0026rsquo;t provide this as a paid service since that comes with a lot of liability and legal documents to protect yourself, so I just offer it as a free service for friends.\nVM Templates \u0026amp; Operating Systems I already use Proxmox VE for personal vms so I\u0026rsquo;m using my existing setup for this service.\nCurrently I have a vm template for Debian 13 \u0026ldquo;Trixie\u0026rdquo;, which lets me spin up new machines with unattended updates and the setup process already complete.\nNetworking \u0026amp; Public IPs I had to get a bit creative here as residential internet connections don\u0026rsquo;t let you have multiple public ip addresses on your connection.\nTo get around this I run a vps with multiple public ips which has a secure encrypted tunnel back into a tailscale gateway running inside my home network which exposes the vm subnets/network, this setup also means I don\u0026rsquo;t have to install tailscale on any vms.\nIf someone connected to [public_vps_ip]:22 it gets relayed to [private_vm_ip]:22 through the tunnel and it all happens seemlessly.\nThis all happens behind the scenes without any noticeable latency (1-2ms latency between vps and my network, tailscale gateway gets under 0.2ms to vms)\nInternal Network Security Obviously one of the main security risks with running a service like this in my Homelab isn\u0026rsquo;t really external attacks, its vms being breached and then attacking or breaking into stuff on my home network.\nTo mitigate this I have a security group on the Proxmox firewall with a list of rules denying access to anything on my local network except the router (for internet) and tailscale gateway (to expose services). Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

So I had the idea of letting other people run their own linux virtual machines on it, kinda like how gcp offers \u0026ldquo;spot\u0026rdquo; vms for much cheaper as it uses excess compute capacity.\nObviously I can\u0026rsquo;t provide this as a paid service since that comes with a lot of liability and legal documents to protect yourself, so I just offer it as a free service for friends.\nVM Templates \u0026amp; Operating Systems I already use Proxmox VE for personal vms so I\u0026rsquo;m using my existing setup for this service.\nCurrently I have a vm template for Debian 13 \u0026ldquo;Trixie\u0026rdquo;, which lets me spin up new machines with unattended updates and the setup process already complete.\nNetworking \u0026amp; Public IPs I had to get a bit creative here as residential internet connections don\u0026rsquo;t let you have multiple public ip addresses on your connection.\nTo get around this I run a vps with multiple public ips which has a secure encrypted tunnel back into a tailscale gateway running inside my home network which exposes the vm subnets/network, this setup also means I don\u0026rsquo;t have to install tailscale on any vms.\nIf someone connected to [public_vps_ip]:22 it gets relayed to [private_vm_ip]:22 through the tunnel and it all happens seemlessly.\nThis all happens behind the scenes without any noticeable latency (1-2ms latency between vps and my network, tailscale gateway gets under 0.2ms to vms)\nInternal Network Security Obviously one of the main security risks with running a service like this in my Homelab isn\u0026rsquo;t really external attacks, its vms being breached and then attacking or breaking into stuff on my home network.\nTo mitigate this I have a security group on the Proxmox firewall with a list of rules denying access to anything on my local network except the router (for internet) and tailscale gateway (to expose services). Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.

Running it on the hypervisor level adds an extra layer of security because you\u0026rsquo;d need access to Proxmox which is also firewalled off.\nConclusion This setup is still in the early stages of development, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple days so I\u0026rsquo;ll improve over time as I make it more robust and reliable, one of my goals for later on is to add something like high availability or an automated system as most of it is manual right now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vps-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA lot of my Homelab typically sits idle, wasting power.

Many people have to deal with things like CGNAT (no public ip) and annoying ISPs.\nSo here are a few free and paid solutions for exposing both web applications and game servers to the internet without port forwarding.\nCloudflare Tunnels This is a completely free service which supports exposing only web applications to the internet using an application (cloudflared) running on your server which tunnels traffic out and exposes it via the Cloudflare Network\nSome argue that it defeats the point of self-hosting since Cloudflare centralizes the web while the indie webs goal is the opposite, however its a great service for exposing applications for free if your fine with that tradeoff.\nTailscale (w/ an optional VPS) This solution can be either free or paid depending on if you want just yourself to be able to access your services or you want them to be exposed via a domain. You can setup Tailscale on both your devices and the server then securely connect to eachother without exposing anything publicly for completely free.\nIf you want a service to be publicly accessible via a domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a remote server with its own public ip address as Tailscale only lets you establish secure connections between devices, not expose things to the internet.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d install Tailscale on your home server and remote server, then on the remote server you install for example caddy and setup a reverse proxy to your home servers Tailscale address, an example config is shown below.\nexample.com {\rreverse_proxy http://100.85.48.32\r} Additionally, you can use this to expose any tcp/udp service, including Game Servers, SSH, (S)FTP and much more which requires forwarding ports from a remote server to your home servers Tailscale address but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident explaining how to do that.\nPlayit.gg Arguably the best free service for exposing game servers without port forwarding. The setup includes installing a program which tunnels game server traffic to their global network of relay servers.\nIts super easy to setup, you can watch a video guide here.\nYou can also use it to expose any tcp port with a dedicated IPV4 but Tailscale w/ a VPS or CF Tunnels (for websites) is a better option since playit is primarily for game servers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/exposing-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world everyone could port forward and use an ISP with DDoS Protection and Static IPs, however we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world.
