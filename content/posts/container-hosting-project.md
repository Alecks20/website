I've always wished there was a service with super low spec plans for dirt-cheap prices that could reliably host my tiny projects or web applications, that can also scale up if you need more power.

So why not try and build one myself, with a huge Dedicated Server and some smart overallocation I could easy host dozens of containers and provide them for cheap, most services in the managed hosting scene target large enterprise customers but I want to make something thats genuinely great for students and hobbyists, something I would actually use myself and fills the gap in the market.

Heres a few features I want working before the Alpha launch.
- Login with GitHub - with integration for more Git providers later (Codeberg, GitLab)
- Super simple to use for beginners while still providing advanced features for power users (e.g Environment Variables & Custom Domains)
- Automatically repull containers when a new version is pushed 
- Custom domain support - for free
- Internal private communication between your Containers

Then these are some features I'll be adding later on.
- Build containers from a Dockerfile in a Git repo
- Dedicated Public IPs for containers
- Self-hosted applications library, with one-click deploys for services like Gitea, Wordpress, Flarum, Matrix, Vaultwarden and much more.
- Container volume backups

Some additional services I've considered which add on to the ecosystem and let you deploy even more without depending on other services.
- Object Storage (S3-Compatible API)
- Shared & Dedicated database hosting (MariaDB, Postgres, MongoDB)

Now for the best part, my plans for pricing
- 0.25 vCPU, 128MB RAM, 2GB Storage - Free Plan
- 0.5 vCPU, 256MB RAM, 4GB Storage - $1/month
- 1 vCPU, 512MB RAM, 6GB Storage - $3/month
- 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 8GB Storage - $5/month
- 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 10GB Storage - $7/month

These are likely bound to change, however the $1-3/month plans and free tier will definitely be coming.

Thats all I have laid out for now, I've been working super hard to get a prototype working I'll post another update after some progress.
