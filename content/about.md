I'm a teenager living in Australia from a small town in New Zealand who happens to be a self-taught developer highly skilled in various tech fields - [my skills](/skills)

This website is used to have my own little corner of the internet, showcase my practical experience and serve as a time capsule for my writings, it also helps solidify learnings as explaining things to other people is one of the best ways to remember things.

Outside of IT I love documentaries (tech, hacking, politics, economics and true crime), anime, fixing up/reviving old thinkpads or devices and designing things.
