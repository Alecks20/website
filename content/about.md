I'm a teenager living in Australia from a small town in New Zealand who happens to be a self-taught developer highly skilled in various tech fields - [my skills](/skills). 

I'm passionate about computers, tinkering, homelabbing, self-hosting, networking, digital infrastructure, giving old tech new lives to reduce ewaste, programming, system administration, cybersecurity, linux, open source software, cloud computing, virtualization, self-driven learning and experimentation.

This website is my own little corner of the internet to showcase my practical experience and serve as a time capsule for writings, it also helps solidify learnings as explaining things to other people is one of the best ways to remember things.

Outside of IT I love documentaries (tech, hacking, politics, economics and true crime), anime, fixing up/reviving old thinkpads or devices and designing things.
